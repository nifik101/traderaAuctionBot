## 2024-08-19 15:45:00

## 2024-08-19 16:00:00

- **Action:** Executed Task #4: Backend Code Review and Import Verification.
- **Details:**
    - **(4.1)** Reviewed `main.py`: Standard FastAPI setup, CORS configured, basic logging, loads `.env`, includes routers from `routes/`, defines `/` and `/health` endpoints.
    - **(4.2)** Reviewed `db.py` and `models.py`: Supabase client initialized from `.env`, SQL schema defined in `db.py` (no ORM/migrations), helper functions for DB operations provided. Pydantic models in `models.py` mirror DB structure but include a **critical mock `get_current_user` dependency** (returns hardcoded user, no real JWT validation).
    - **(4.3)** Reviewed `routes/scripts.py`, `routes/auctions.py`, `routes/bidding.py`:
        - **Critical Security Issue:** No endpoints utilize the (mocked) `get_current_user` dependency, making the API entirely unprotected.
        - **Inconsistency:** Each route file defines its own redundant Pydantic models, often differing from `models.py` and the DB schema.
        - **Inconsistency:** Data handling (e.g., saving auction data) uses fields inconsistent with `models.py`/DB schema.
        - **Security Issue:** `place_bid` accepts token insecurely via request body.
        - **Import Issue:** Uses `sys.path.append` hack to import `tradera_api.py`.
    - **(4.4)** Confirmed authentication mechanism (Clerk JWT intended) is not implemented due to mocked `get_current_user` and lack of usage in routes.
    - **(4.5)** Verified internal imports work but noted the `sys.path.append` issue in route files.
- **Files Affected:** `backend/main.py`, `backend/db.py`, `backend/models.py`, `backend/routes/scripts.py`, `backend/routes/auctions.py`, `backend/routes/bidding.py`
- **Reason:** To perform a detailed review of the backend code, identify issues, and verify imports.
- **Task:** #4

## 2024-08-19 16:15:00

- **Action:** Executed Task #5: Frontend Code Review and Import Verification.
- **Details:**
    - **(5.1)** Reviewed `components/` (`Layout.jsx`, `ProtectedRoute.jsx`, etc.): Basic layout and Clerk-based route protection components found, structure seems logical.
    - **(5.2)** Reviewed `App.jsx` and `pages/`: Routing uses React Router v6 with nested routes under a main `Layout`. Protected routes use `ProtectedRoute`. `/login` is a placeholder. Page components (`Dashboard`, `ScriptManagement`, etc.) exist in `pages/`.
    - **(5.3)** Reviewed `contexts/` (`ApiContext.jsx`, `SupabaseContext.jsx`): `ApiContext` provides API call wrappers and global loading state. `SupabaseContext` provides Supabase client and handles auth session state via `onAuthStateChange`.
    - **(5.4)** Reviewed `api/` (`index.js`, `services.js`, etc.) and `ScriptManagement.jsx`: Axios instance configured with base URL and interceptors for adding Clerk auth token (via `window.Clerk`) and handling 401 errors. API calls made via `useApi` hook. Data fetching/state handled locally in components. Found missing `toggle` endpoint call in `ScriptManagement`.
    - **(5.5)** Assessed dependencies and UI: Clerk, Supabase, Axios, React Router used correctly. React Hook Form installed but not seen in use in reviewed files. UI is basic, uses custom CSS, lacks a component library. UX needs improvement (error handling, loading states).
- **Files Affected:** `frontend/src/main.jsx`, `frontend/src/App.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/*`, `frontend/src/pages/*`, `frontend/src/contexts/*`, `frontend/src/api/*`
- **Reason:** To perform a detailed review of the frontend code, identify issues, verify imports and dependencies.
- **Task:** #5

## 2024-08-19 16:25:00

- **Action:** Executed Task #6: API Specification Documentation Update.
- **Details:** Created `docs/API_SPEC.md` and documented all backend API endpoints found in `routes/` during Task #4. This included:
    - Documenting Root (`/`, `/health`) and endpoints for Scripts, Auctions, and Bidding.
    - Noting HTTP methods, path/query parameters, request bodies, and response formats.
    - **Highlighting critical lack of authentication/authorization on all endpoints.**
    - **Highlighting insecure token handling in `place_bid` endpoint.**
    - **Noting inconsistencies between local Pydantic models in routes and central models/DB schema.**
    - Documenting observed error handling patterns (404, 400, 500).
- **Files Affected:** `docs/API_SPEC.md` (Created)
- **Reason:** To create an accurate documentation of the implemented API based on code review findings.
- **Task:** #6

## 2024-08-19 16:30:00

- **Action:** Executed Task #7: Data Model Documentation Update.
- **Details:** Created `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` and documented the database schema based on `backend/db.py`. Includes details for tables (`users`, `search_scripts`, `auctions`, `bid_configs`, `bids`), columns, types, constraints, relationships, and indexes.
- **Files Affected:** `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` (Created)
- **Reason:** To provide accurate documentation of the database structure.
- **Task:** #7

## 2024-08-19 16:35:00

- **Files Affected:** `README.md`, `.env.example` (Created)
- **Reason:** To ensure the README provides correct and helpful setup instructions.
- **Task:** #8

## 2024-08-19 16:40:00

- **Action:** Executed Task #9: Code Cleanup Identification.
- **Details:** Created `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` identifying potential cleanup areas based on previous code reviews (Tasks #4 & #5). Includes unused dependencies (React Hook Form, Pytest), duplicated Pydantic models and search logic in backend routes, import hacks (`sys.path.append`), mock authentication, inconsistent models, and a missing backend endpoint (`toggle script`). No code was modified.
- **Files Affected:** `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` (Created)
- **Reason:** To document potential technical debt and areas for future refactoring.
- **Task:** #9

### 2024-08-19

**Task #10: Final Verification and Baseline Report**
- **Action:** Executed Task #10.
- **Details:** Reviewed existing documentation (`README.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`) for consistency and accuracy. Created `docs/BASELINE_REPORT.md` summarizing codebase state, architecture, technologies, functions, known issues, and recommendations for Phase 1 development (addressing security, model inconsistencies, code duplication, etc.).
