- Dependency verification and installation (Task #2)
- Server startup verification (Task #3)
- Backend code review (Task #4)
- Frontend code review (Task #5)
- API specification documentation update (Task #6)
- Data model documentation update (Task #7)
- README documentation update (Task #8)
- Code cleanup identification (Task #9)
- Final verification and this report generation (Task #10)

Detailed logs of actions taken are available in `changelog.md`.

## 2. Architecture and Component Structure (Subtask 10.2)

- **Overall Architecture:** Fullstack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`):
    - **Framework/Lib:** React (JavaScript/JSX), Vite, React Router, Axios.
    - **Structure:** Component-based (`components/`, `pages/`), Context API (`contexts/`) for API calls (`ApiContext`) and Supabase session (`SupabaseContext`), API service layer (`api/`), CSS for styling.
    - **Key Components:** `Layout`, `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `ProtectedRoute`, Page components (`Dashboard`, `ScriptManagement`, `AuctionListing`, `Statistics`).
- **Backend (`backend/`):
    - **Framework/Lib:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Supabase client, python-dotenv.
    - **Structure:** `main.py` (app setup, CORS, root endpoints), `routes/` (separate files for scripts, auctions, bidding), `db.py` (DB client init, helper functions, SQL schema), `models.py` (Pydantic models, mock auth dependency), `tradera_api.py` (external API interaction - *not fully reviewed*).
    - **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
    - **Authentication Provider:** Clerk.

## 4. Functional Capabilities Currently Implemented (Subtask 10.3)

*Note: Based on code review, actual functionality might differ due to identified issues (e.g., lack of auth).* 

- **Backend API:**
    - **Scripts:** CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for search scripts stored in DB. Endpoint to trigger a script run (searches Tradera, updates DB).
    - **Auctions:** Read and Delete operations for auctions stored in DB. Endpoint to perform a one-off Tradera search and store/update results in DB.
    - **Bidding:** CRUD operations for bid configurations stored in DB. Endpoint to place a bid via Tradera API and store result in DB.
    - **Basic:** Root (`/`) and health check (`/health`) endpoints.
- **Frontend UI:**
    - **Layout:** Basic application layout with Navbar and Sidebar.
    - **Authentication:** Integration with Clerk for login state (`useUser`, `ProtectedRoute`, `UserButton`). Redirects to `/sign-in` on unauthorized access attempt (via Axios interceptor).
    - **Routing:** Navigation between Dashboard, Scripts, Auctions, Statistics pages.
    - **Script Management:** UI to list, create, edit, delete, and toggle (partially implemented - missing backend endpoint) search scripts via a table and modal form.
    - **Other Pages:** Placeholder components exist for Dashboard, Auction Listing, Statistics, but their specific functionality and API integrations were not fully reviewed in this phase.

## 5. Known Issues and Limitations (Subtask 10.3)

*See `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` for more details.*

- **CRITICAL - Security:** Backend API lacks authentication and authorization. All endpoints are currently unprotected.
- **CRITICAL - Security:** Insecure token handling in `POST /api/auctions/{auction_id}/bid` (token passed in request body).
- **Inconsistency:** Redundant and inconsistent Pydantic models between `backend/models.py` and `backend/routes/*.py`.
- **Inconsistency:** Data handling logic (e.g., saving auction data from Tradera API) uses fields/types inconsistent with DB schema/central models.
- **Duplication:** Backend logic for searching Tradera and saving auctions is duplicated.
- **Bad Practice:** Backend uses `sys.path.append` hack for internal imports.
- **Incompleteness:** Frontend `toggle script` functionality lacks a corresponding backend endpoint.
- **Potential Bug:** Frontend dependencies (`react-hook-form`, etc.) installed but may be unused.
- **Potential Bug:** Backend test dependencies (`pytest`, etc.) installed but test suite status is unknown.
- **UX:** Frontend error handling is minimal (console logs only); loading indicators are basic.
- **DB Management:** No database migration tool is configured; relies on manual schema setup via `db.py` or Supabase UI.

## 6. Recommendations for Phase 1 (Subtask 10.4)

Based on the baseline assessment, the following actions are recommended as high priority for the next development phase:

1.  **Implement Backend Authentication & Authorization:**
    - Replace mock `get_current_user` with actual Clerk JWT validation.
    - Apply the `get_current_user` dependency to *all* relevant API endpoints to protect them.
    - Implement proper authorization checks (e.g., user can only modify their own scripts/bid configs).
    - Secure the `place_bid` endpoint (remove token from body, rely on validated header token).
2.  **Refactor Backend Models & Routes:**
    - Consolidate Pydantic models: Remove local models in `routes/*.py` and use/update the central models in `models.py`.
    - Ensure data consistency between API models, DB schema, and data handling logic.
3.  **Refactor Backend Services:**
    - Extract duplicated auction search/save logic into a shared service/function.
4.  **Fix Backend Imports:**
    - Remove `sys.path.append` hack and use relative imports or package structure.
5.  **Address Frontend/Backend Mismatches:**
    - Implement the `toggle script` backend endpoint or remove the frontend button.
6.  **Improve Frontend UX:**
    - Implement user-facing error messages (e.g., toasts, form errors).
    - Consider more granular loading indicators.
7.  **Review/Implement Tradera API Logic (`tradera_api.py`):**
    - Perform a detailed review of this crucial file, which was not covered in Phase 0.
    - Ensure correct handling of Tradera credentials and API responses/errors.
8.  **Verify/Remove Unused Dependencies:**
    - Check frontend pages for `react-hook-form` usage and remove if unnecessary.
    - Determine status of backend tests and remove `pytest` if unused.
