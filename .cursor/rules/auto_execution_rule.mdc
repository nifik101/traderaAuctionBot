- **Always continue executing tasks without asking for permission**
  - The AI agent must not pause or request confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
  - Execution is driven entirely by the active `task-master` plan.

- **Use `mcp tools` as needed to proceed**
  - Unlock dependencies
  - Process complex steps or sub-tasks
  - Access helper utilities to complete logic chains

- **Autonomous task flow**
  - When a task is completed, the AI should immediately identify and begin the next one.
  - Fallback mechanisms should be applied automatically if a task fails.

- **Logging and traceability**
  - All actions must be logged continuously in @changelog.md
  - Include timestamps, affected files, reasons for changes, and links to tasks or rules

- **DO:**
  ```typescript
  // âœ… Good: Automatically proceed to next task without interruption
  await runTask('task-002')
